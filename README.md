# Hangman

Great Guitarist Hangman.

A Javascript game.

Just like regular Hangman, only all the answers
will be Some of the "Greatest" Guitar players to have graced the airwaves.
(at least according to the general public).

The game works by using any character or the space bar to activate the game.

Try to guess the "Hidden" guitar player by guessing letters.
As you guess letters they will be kept track of.
You have 10 guesses per game.

If you guess correctly you get a win in the win column.
If you use all your guesses before revealing the "hidden" guitarist
you will receive a loss in the loss column.

To start the next game: Press any key or the space bar to reveal your next
guitarist.
